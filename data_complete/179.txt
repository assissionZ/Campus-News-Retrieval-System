In particular, the low-dimension and high-frequency scaling may promise a lot more interesting applications, while the challenges in design principle and fabrication capability will become critical limits. Nano-patterned surfaces to modulate and structure novel light behavior will be studied and the following advanced functionalities will be discussed, e.g., farfield super-resolution imaging, 3D meta-hologram, dynamic OAM generation, plasmonic high-resolution prints, etc. Our work paves a roadmap to design sophisticated and advanced optical devices, with low dimension, miniaturization, randomness, and scaled-up capability. &nbsp; 报告人简介:Prof. Cheng-Wei Qiu received his B.Eng. and Ph. D. degree in 2003 and 2007, respectively. He was a Postdoctoral Fellow at Physics Department in MIT till the end of 2009.
