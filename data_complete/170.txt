However, human vision is far more complex than it looks like. In the last decade, computer vision, especially in the field of visual recognition, has been developed prosperously, mostly driven by machine learning technology. On one side, machine learning formulates diverse computer vision problems as proper mathematical models and solves them efficiently. On the other side, computer vision rooting in real-world scenarios serves as a great testbed to evaluate the validity and the efficiency of machine learning methods.In this talk, I will briefly review my research activities on different novel machine learning solutions for real-world visual recognition problems, specifically, kernel method for general object classification and detection, energy minimization for long-term object tracking and deep learning for face recognition.嘉宾简介：Yang Hua will start as a Lecturer (equivalent to Assistant Professor) at Queen’s University Belfast, UK in July 2017. He obtained his Ph.D. under the supervision of Dr. Cordelia Schmid and Dr. Karteek Alahari in Inria LEAR/THOTH team, France. His Ph.D. research was funded by the scholarship of the Microsoft Research - Inria joint center.&nbsp; Yang Hua is now a research scientist at AnyVision (UK office). Before his Ph.D. study, he worked as a senior R&amp;D engineer at Panasonic R&amp;D Center Singapore from 2008 to 2012, where he was engaged in a long-term research project and the related industrial product development.&nbsp; With more than nine-year combined experience of research and engineering in computer vision and machine learning, he published several first-tier international journal articles and conference papers with more than 460 citations, he holds/co-holds three US patents and one China patent, he designed and developed fully optimized image classification module for Panasonic’s new product line launched in Japan, and he won four titles of prestigious international competitions in computer vision spanning image and video domains, including the PASCAL Visual Object Classes (VOC) Challenge Classi&#64257;cation Competition and the Thermal Imagery Visual Object Tracking (VOT-TIR) Competition. 欢迎各位老师和同学参加。 （更新于2017-6-21 16:11:00　点击数:4627） 首页 ｜ 新闻 ｜ 公文通 ｜ http://www1.szu.edu.cn/board/view.asp?id=342369
