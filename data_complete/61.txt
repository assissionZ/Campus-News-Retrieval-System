But nobody knows how many algorithms currently for machine learning, and we have not yet find a better taxonomy about how to fully understand whole of machine learning. This talk will try to explain machine learning from three perspectives, and then to look ahead the trends of machine learning used in computer vision, information retrieval, and so on. 嘉宾简介：Wenmin Wang received the Ph.D. degree in computer science and technology from Harbin Institute of Technology, in 1989. Thereafter, he was an Associate Professor at Harbin University of Science and Technology, as well as Harbin Institute of Technology. Since 1992, he gained the oversea industrial experiences for about 18 years in Japan and America, served as a Staff Engineer, Chief Engineer, or General Manager of Software Division, for some IT companies. In the end of 2009, he was invited to return China as a Professor at the School of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Peking University, Shenzhen. In recent years, he as a corresponding author published over 38 international conference/journal papers including NIPS, AAAI, ICMR, ICME, ICASSP, ICIP, TMM and TCSVT, furthermore he received IEEE BigMM 2017 Best Paper Award and IEEE VCIP 2016 Best Top 10% Paper Award. His current research interests include computer vision, multimedia retrieval, artificial intelligence and machine learning.欢迎各位老师和同学参加。 （更新于2017-6-23 10:20:00　点击数:4852） 首页 ｜ 新闻 ｜ 公文通 ｜ http://www1.szu.edu.cn/board/view.asp?id=342366
