Foreign member of Armenian Academy of Sciences. Talk IntroductionMathematics and physics have the same roots and were always closely related to eachother. But at the beginning of XXth century the question of their interrelations acquired a new meaning. This was due to the breakthrough discoveries in theoretical physics--creation of quantum mechanics and general relativity. Both theories used heavily mathematical methods, existing at that time, namely, functional analysis and differential geometry. New directions in theoretical physics developed at the end of XXth century require new mathematical methods still lacking in mathematics. This a major challenge for mathematicians of XXIth century. 时间：2017年6月23日上午9:00-10:00地点：南图书馆报告厅All are welcome！ &nbsp;附件（建议下载操作：鼠标右键→目标另存为）：・20170623高等研究院名师讲堂（第二十期）prof.sergeev.jpg （更新于2017-6-20 13:22:00　点击数:5651） 首页 ｜ 新闻 ｜ 公文通 ｜ http://www1.szu.edu.cn/board/view.asp?id=342103
