　学术报告十五：Universal Teichmuller space: non-trivial example of infinite Cdimensional complex manifolds 数学与统计学院　2017-6-22 11:26:00 数学与统计学院学术报告[2017] 015号 (高水平大学建设系列报告085号) 讲座题目:&nbsp; Universal Teichmuller space: non-trivial example of infinite Cdimensional complex manifolds 讲座人：A. &nbsp;Sergeev &nbsp;（ Steklov Mathematical Institute） 讲座时间：2017.06.23, 下午14：00-15：00 讲座地点： &nbsp;科技楼501 　　&nbsp;&nbsp;　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 报告内容： There is an opinion that it is impossible to construct a general theory of infinite-dimensional complex manifolds. The reason is that such manifolds differ a lot from each other so that any of them deserves a separate theory and such separate theories cannot be united into one general theory. It is hard to say whether this point of view is true but at least it justifies a thorough study of non-trivial examples of infinite-dimensional complex manifolds. One of such examples is provided by the universal Teichmuller space and we shall present in our talk main geometric features of this remarkable infinite-dimensional manifold. 报告人简历 Professor Sergeev is a leading scientific researcher in Steklov Mathematical Institute, Moscow. He got his Doctor of Science degree in 1989 from Steklov Institute. He is a Professor in Lomonosov Moscow State University (from 1994) and in Higher School of Economics (from 2013). He is Editor-in Chief of Steklov Institute Proceedings and Proceedings of Moscow Mathematical Society and also Deputy Editor-in-Chief of Izvestiya Mathematics. From 2017 he is a Vice-President of European Mathematical Society. He is the author of 7 books and more than 80 papers. Research interests: complex analysis and mathematical physics. Foreign member of Armenian Academy of Sciences. &nbsp; &nbsp; 数学与统计学院 2017-06-22 （更新于2017-6-22 11:42:00　点击数:3732） 首页 ｜ 新闻 ｜ 公文通 ｜ http://www1.szu.edu.cn/board/view.asp?id=342429
