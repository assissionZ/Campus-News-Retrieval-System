He got his Doctor of Science degree in 1989 from Steklov Institute. He is a Professor in Lomonosov Moscow State University (from 1994) and in Higher School of Economics (from 2013). He is Editor-in Chief of Steklov Institute Proceedings and Proceedings of Moscow Mathematical Society and also Deputy Editor-in-Chief of Izvestiya Mathematics. From 2017 he is a Vice-President of European Mathematical Society. He is the author of 7 books and more than 80 papers. Research interests: complex analysis and mathematical physics. Foreign member of Armenian Academy of Sciences. Talk IntroductionMathematics and physics have the same roots and were always closely related to eachother. But at the beginning of XXth century the question of their interrelations acquired a new meaning. This was due to the breakthrough discoveries in theoretical physics--creation of quantum mechanics and general relativity. Both theories used heavily mathematical methods, existing at that time, namely, functional analysis and differential geometry. New directions in theoretical physics developed at the end of XXth century require new mathematical methods still lacking in mathematics. This a major challenge for mathematicians of XXIth century.
