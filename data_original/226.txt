He got his doctoral degree in 1995 from Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences. After a few years of post©\doc researches in Peking University, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST, Japan) and University of Illinois at Urbana©\Champaign (UIUC, USA), he joined Institute of Chemistry, CAS in 2004, supported by the Hundred Talented Program. He was awarded the Outstanding Young Investigator Grant of National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC), and was elected to be a Fellow of American Physical Society (APS) in 2013, due to his successful application of single molecule fluorescence spectroscopy to polymer physics study. Jiang Zhao¡¯s group conducts basic researches in polymer physics and soft matter physics, including charged macromolecules, colloids, polymer interfaces, thin films, crystallization and glass transition. Talk IntroductionThe development of modern physics and chemistry has made a huge demand for the basic understanding at single molecular level. In polymer science and soft matter science, accessing information of single polymer molecules is believed to be the key to the understanding of polymer physics and chemistry ¨C a determining factor of the overall performance and properties of the polymeric systems as materials and biological organism, etc. In this talk, I will introduce our recent advances in the investigation of a few topics in polymer physics by single molecule fluorescence microscopy and spectroscopy, including molecular conformation and counterion distribution of charged macromolecules, single chain motion in the mass transportation process of polymer crystallization, as well as single segmental dynamics of glass transition. The results have exposed vast amount of information which were not available before, demonstrating the successfulness of single molecule fluorescence techniques in the exploration of polymer physics.
